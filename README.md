## API
API used: Northwind <br/><br/>
The json-server needs to be initialized because the API is used in the project.<br/><br/>
This process needs to be done in a different terminal tab.<br/><br/>
Go to the api folder by going to the top directory.<br/><br/>
`cd..` <br/><br/>
`cd api` <br/><br/>
`json-server --watch db.json` <br/><br/>
This process will run on port 3000.<br/><br/>
Therefore, the application running on port 3000 will not work. The project is restarted by going to the terminal where the project is run.<br/><br/>
